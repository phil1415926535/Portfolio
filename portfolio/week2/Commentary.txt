Not too secure but the password I've set for the program is: "1234"
or you can make your own by running ./setPassword.sh or running ./pwmaker.sh and choosing folder in week2 called secretpw and putting in file called secretpw.txt
Enjoy :)

pwdirlog.txt stores path to file when creating password file initially with pwandfoldermaker.sh and uses this with a cat command in other scripts.
